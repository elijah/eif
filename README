This is a revised release of good old eif.

Virtually no functionalty has been added since the last, final release by
Doug Hay. It's just been made to compile on today's Linux and *BSD systems
and will probably compile on a lot of other systems as well.

Since I have not yet had the time to redocument it all and since I do
not think it necessary, the documentation of the original version is still
present in the doc directory.

I did however compile it into a manual page.
