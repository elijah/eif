CURRENT BUGS:

   - There is a problem with connections over VERY slow links.
     It has to do with timing out on the connection.
     It has even shown up as the dreaded nuke bug, for other
     reasons.  EIF may be more susceptable to the nuke bug
     than emp_client.
     The only problem is that you need a slow link to debug
     it.

   - When you hit ^C, weird output may occur from the client, until
     things sort themselves out.
