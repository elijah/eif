Announcing the first general release of EIF.

A new Empire InterFace.


Early this year I finally decided that emp_client was insufficient
for my needs.  After looking around at several of the other
clients underdevelopment, I decided that they were also insufficient
for my desires.  I wanted a better interface, not something that
played my game for me.

So... eif was born.

What is eif?
   Aliases with parameters.
   Command history, substitution, etc.  Courtesy of GNU.
   Variables.
   Minor conditionals.  (if, elseif, else, endif)
   Various forms of file redirection, piping and execution.

What doesn't eif do?
   Eif does not play your game for you.  Use GEET, Eddie or Xemp.
   Eif knows next to nothing about the game of empire.
   Eif does not use Xwindows, Sunview, etc.  It is command line based.

Where is eif?
   At an ftp site near you.

Support?
   Virtually non-existent.  This may be the one and only release of eif.
   It has been tested quite a bit, and hopefully has no major bugs left.

   Enhancements?  Code them yourself.

   OS's?  Known to compile and run on SunOS and MipsOS.  Probably most
   others as well.

Previous Versions
   There are a couple of beta test versions that are wandering around.
   This fixes most/all of the known bugs with those, and has a couple
   of enhancements.  Also, a lot of the code was restructured.
   But, use what you want.

Disclaimer
   Standard disclaimer.  For free?  You fix it.



Good Luck, and may you lose gracefully.
