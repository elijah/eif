Jun 6 1991
    Added a runtime option to disable "^G" in the output.  Prevents the
   terminal from beeping repetively when doing zillions of "fire"s, or
   other things like that.


May 30 1991
    Fixed a bunch of little things to do with echoing the command line
   into a redirected file.  This is necessary for many empire tools which
   use the first line to figure out what the rest of the data file is.
    This worked originally, but in cleaning up the code, broke it.  Stupid.
   Shouldn't screw so much with working code.

May 30 1991
    Fixed "^C" so that it will abort the current command.  Was unable to
   abort telegrams and announcements.  Not sure when this problem developed,
   but pretty sure it worked at one time previously.

May 30 1991
    Telegrams and announcements can now have ";" in them.  This means
    that you can't do:
        tele 2 ; Hi there ; . 
    You now have to type each line explicitly.

----------- Version 1.0.2 ------------

Jan 1994  Jim Gillogly
    Fixed the "kill" command in expect.c.

26 May 1994  Ken Stevens
    removed the -g option in Makefile to make the executable smaller.

26 May 1994  Ken Stevens
    added a #define option "FUNNY_HIGH" in print.c.  If highlighting isn't
    working on your terminal, then #define FUNNY_HIGH in print.c.
